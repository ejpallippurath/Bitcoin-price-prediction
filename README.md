## bitcoin-price-prediction

### Overview
It is a machine learning project aimed at building a predictive model for the future price of Bitcoin using historical data. The project will use the Random Forest Regression algorithm, which is a popular supervised learning algorithm used for regression and classification tasks. The model will be trained on historical data and used to make future predictions on the next 30 days Bitcoin prices.

### Data 
The first step in this project is to collect historical data on Bitcoin prices. This data obtained from sources as CSV files. The data include features such as price and date. The historical data will be used to train the Random Forest Regression model.

### Model Training
Once the data has been preprocessed and the relevant features selected, the next step is to train the Random Forest Regression model. The dataset will be split into training and testing sets, with the training set used to train the model. The Random Forest Regression algorithm works by creating multiple decision trees and combining their outputs to make predictions. The model will be trained on historical data and used to make future predictions on Bitcoin prices.

### Model Evaluation
The performance of the model will be evaluated using various performance metrics. The testing set will be used to evaluate the performance of the model. These metrics will be used to determine the accuracy and reliability of the model.

### Model Prediction
The final step in this project is to deploy the trained model to make future predictions on Bitcoin prices. The model will be used to predict the future prices of Bitcoin based on the historical data used to train the model. These predictions can be used for various applications such as trading and investment decision making.
